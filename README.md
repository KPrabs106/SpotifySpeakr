## Introduction
You're with a group of friends and want to play some music from Spotify. Without a dedicated speaker, there's no way that the music will be loud enough for everyone to enjoyably listen. But what if you could use the in-built speakers on everyone's phone instead?

## Overview
There's a very small margin of playback time difference (roughly 80 ms), which means that keeping the devices in sync with each other is critical. To complicate this, Android devices use network to get the time, which means that devices can have different times. To ensure the best quality, each command (play, pause, skip, previous) has a delay of up to ten seconds to maintain sync with all the devices.
